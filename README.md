# The PDO and MySQL querries are of an older type someone using this might want to Change the PDO method to a better one and might want to use MySQLI instead of MySQL
# The dbconnect.php file requires the user to edit information to their needs so that the connection to the database is sucessful. If left as it is you will not be able to
# connect anywhere. 

# This is demonstrational code!
