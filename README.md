# Some PHP Code allowing the user to accces a database of their choice and interact with it using SQL statements allowing to update, delete, edit user or order data.
# This code is just demonstrational and some variables would need to be changed to work properly for someone else in their system. 
# The PDO and MySQL querries are of an older type someone using this might want to Change the PDO method to a better one and might want to use MySQLI instead of MySQL
# The dbconnect.php file requires the user to edit information to their needs so that the connection to the database is sucessful. If left as it is you will not be able to
# connect anywhere. 

# This is demonstrational code! 
# Although it works fine and might be fine for some users i would recommend using this code just as a refference for understanding some concepts of PHP and serverside scripting
